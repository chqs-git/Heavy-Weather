> [[Heavy Weather]] is a volumetric cloud editor designed to create most clouds, but specifically *Cumulonimbus*.

*Comulonimbus* are clouds defined by being gigantic bodies of volume.


## Cloud Characteristics
> To properly represent *Comulonimbus* clouds and the alike, aswell as to have appealing clouds there are some important key characteristics to follow.

**Ideal cloud characteristics**:
- & dense;
- ! huge;
- ~ soft shadows.

This characteristics are based on the gallery at: [[References]]

## Implementation
> The volumetric cloud shape is implemented using **OpenGL** fragment shaders.

Using *raymarching*.

The cloud shape is built with the combination of two *algorithms*: 
-  [[Cloud flood]] algorithm;
- [[Worley Noise]] algorithm.
