> Procedural algorithm used to generate pseudo-random patterns. It was developed by Steven Worley in 1996 and is commonly used in computer graphics and procedural texture generation. 
> 
> This algorithm creates a cellular pattern by dividing space into cells, where each cell is associated with a point known as a seed or feature point.

## Overview
> Algorithm steps.

1. Initialize a grid or space with a specified resolution.
2. Generate a set of random seed points (feature points) within the grid.
3. For each point in the grid, calculate the distance to each seed point.
4. Assign the grid point to the closest seed point.
5. Optionally, calculate additional metrics such as distance to the second-closest seed point (for smoothness variations) or distance to the nth-closest seed point.
6. Apply additional operations or post-processing to modify the resulting noise pattern.

## Application
> How this algorithm is used to build clouds.

The *"Billow"* shapes that can be observed in the texture generated by this algorithm have a strong resemblance to the real world cloud bumps.

Using the [[Overlay operator]] the data from this texture can be applied to a shape to give this shape the bumpy cloud detail.
